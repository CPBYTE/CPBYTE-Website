### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Node.js** and **npm** (or yarn/pnpm/bun) installed.

### Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev

```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
